# ADA-University-Practice

- Repo contains All the programs from University ADA Subject implemented in C and will eventually include for golang aswell for     personal use

### How to run ? 

1. Just clone the repo using git clone http or ssh or maybe download the zip (if you are noob enough to not know cloning...)

2. Navigate to the directory of your interest e.g main/sorting for sorting programs by ``` cd main/sorting ```

3. Then if you are using VS Code and have gcc installed simply do ``` gcc <program_name.c> ``` or if u want custom file name then ``` gcc <program_name.c> -o <the_name_you_wanna_give_to_file> ```

Example: lets say we got a file "bubble_sort.c" you wanna compile it into "bubble_sort.exe" and not "a.exe" etc so you just do:

``` gcc bubble_sort.c -o bubble_sort.exe ```

4. Done then just execute the executable by ``` ./<executable_name.out> ``` for windows executable name will end with .exe.

Example: linux => ``` ./bubble_sort.out ``` windows => ``` ./bubble_sort.exe ```
